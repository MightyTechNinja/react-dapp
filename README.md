# Basic Sample React DApp Project

This project demonstrates a basic dApp development with React, Ethers.js, Solidity, and Hardhat. I wanted an end to end guide to show me how to build full stack Ethereum apps using the most up to date resources, libraries, and tooling.

# How to install
```
- git clone https://github.com/SmartCoding51/hardhat-react-dapp.git
- copy .env.local to .env
- install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```
